* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
  * :disappointed: = Does not perform any type of setup or configuration of
   Travis CI
  * :confused: = Sets up and configures Travis CI, but does not perform any
   checks
  * :neutral_face: = Partially sets up and configures Travis CI to a less
   relevant extent to perform checks
  * :smiley: = Sufficiently sets up and configures Travis CI to a more
  sufficient extent to perform checks
  * :sunglasses: = Correctly performs the setup and configuration of Travis
   CI to perform checks for all project deliverables

* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
  * :disappointed: = Does not use Travis CI to perform secure releases of
   project deliverables
  * :confused: = Performs unsecured releases of all project deliverables
   through Travis CI
  * :neutral_face: = Performs unsecured releases of most project deliverables
   through Travis CI
  * :smiley: = Performs secured releases of most project deliverables through
   Travis CI
  * :sunglasses: = Performs secured releases of all project deliverables using
   Travis CI
   
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
  * :disappointed: = Does not create third-party integrations with Travis CI
  * :confused: = Creates partially implemented third-party integrations with
  Travis CI
  * :neutral_face: = Fully implements some third-party integrations with Travis
  CI
  * :smiley: = Fully implements most third-party integrations with Travis CI
  * :sunglasses: = Fully implements useful and relevant third-party
  integrations with Travis CI

* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
  * :disappointed: = Does not add README status badges to the project
  * :confused: = Adds README status badges but does not work correctly
  * :neutral_face: = Adds README status badges but is not appropriately located
  * :smiley: = Adds README status badges in the correct location but not
  related to any other badges in the section
  * :sunglasses: = Adds README status badges in the correct location and in
  relation to all other status badges

* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
  * :disappointed: = Does not add README badges to the project
  * :confused: = Does not add README badges that show project characteristics
  * :neutral_face: = Adds improperly located README badges that show project
  characteristics
  * :smiley: = Adds properly located README badges that show project
  characteristics but that are not relevant to the project
  * :sunglasses: = Adds relevant and properly located README badges that show
  project characteristics
  
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI
  * :disappointed: = Does not identify or resolve problems with failing builds
  in Travis CI
  * :confused: = Partially identifies problems with failing builds in Travis CI
  * :neutral_face: = Identifies but does not resolve problems with failing
  builds in Travis CI
  * :smiley: = Identifies and partially resolves problems with failing builds
  in Travis CI
  * :sunglasses: = Fully identifies and resolves problems with failing builds
  in Travis CI

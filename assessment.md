  * Continuous integration with Travis CI
  * Foundations of software engineering

    * 😞 = Makes no attempt at learning any of the
    above material on a consistent basis.
    * 😕 = Attempts to learn some material, but does
    fully not understand the subject at hand.
    Struggles to be an
    independent worker.
    * 😐 = Attempts to learn all material, and
    has a beginner level grasp on the subject at hand.
    * 😃 = Learns materials and has a solid grasp in
    the subject at hand.
    * 😎 = Learns the materials, with an excellent
    knowledge of the subject
    at hand and contributes to the class by asking
    intelligent questions or providing assistance
    to help fellow colleagues learn as well.

* Understanding and avoiding red flags

  * 😞 = Ignores all red flags in code and does not make
    attempts to fix them.
  * 😕 = Identifies red flags, but does not attempt to
    fix them.
  * 😐 = Identifies red flags and fixes some of them.
  * 😃 = Identifies red flags and fixes the majority of
    them.
  * 😎 = Identifies red flags, fixes all of them and
    helps others to fix theirs as well.

* Understanding and adopting best practices

  * 😞 = Fails to understand and adopt beneficial
    practices,
    such as labeling commits, working efficiently and
    utilizing resources to assist in problem solving.
  * 😕 = Adopts a few good practices, but does not
    understand why they are beneficial and fails to
    adopt others.
  * 😐 = Understands all best practices at hand, but
    struggles to adopt all of them.
  * 😃 = Understands and adopts all best practices.
  * 😎 = Understands and adopts all best practices,
    while guiding others to do the same.

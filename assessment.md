# Assessment for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
  * N = **No branches** (other than master) are used, and commits are made
    directly to the master branch.
  * I = A branch is used, but its **name** is **not relevant** to its purpose
    or its function is unnecessary.
  * A = Branch **name** is **relevant** to its function and its function is
    necessary.
  * G = Branch is **properly created** and necessary, and a **pull request** is
    created once work is completed on the branch.
  * E = Branch is **properly created**, and a **pull request** is created once
    work is completed on the branch. **Guidance** is provided to group members
    who need assistance, ensuring that use of branches is **consistent** across
    team members.

A software engineer demonstrates mastery of this technical skill at the E level
by communicating with their team to determine a naming scheme for branches, and
the plan is executed as agreed upon. The branch(es) being used should be named
according to their role (i.e. team2-project-management-with-github), and once
that role is complete/no longer necessary, a pull request should be created to
merge the branch with the main branch.

* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request

* Using appropriate commit messages
  * N = **No commits** are made or commit messages are **blank**
  * I = Commit messages are **arbitrary** and/or **vague**
  * A = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and **content** associated
  with the commit files
  * G = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and **content** as well as
    a **brief description** or list of changes if a commit contains a large
  volume of changes
  * E = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and **content** as well as
    a **brief description** or list of changes if a commit contains a large
    volume of changes. Additionally, **guidance** is provided to the group
    ensuring members are following a consistent and uniform commit structure.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this technical skill at the E
level by engaging with the team to determine an appropriate commit scheme and
structure (e.g. action-content-file or equally descriptive format),
consistently adhering to said structure, and adding commit descriptions if
deemed necessary (e.g. Adding a list of feature additions / changes / removals
or rationale for said actions).

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk
* Software testing
* Software refactoring

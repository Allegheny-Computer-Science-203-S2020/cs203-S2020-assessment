  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

### Revision of Guides

This section describes the policies for revising the assessment form and Code of
Conduct. Revision on either of these two repositories must be approved by
project leader and follow the GitHub Flow Model. Additionally, Pull requests for
revision of either guide must tag multiple TL's, a project leader, and another
classmate.

* Policies for revising the assessment form
  * üòû = Revision on unassigned and assigned sections of the assessment form
      are made without approval, do not follow the GitHub Flow model, and lack a
      Pull request
  * üòï = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval and follow the GitHub flow model, but lack a Pull request
  * üòê = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags a TL
  * üòÉ = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs and Project manager
  * üòé = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs, a Project manager, and another non Project-manager classmate
* Policies for revising the code of conduct
  * üòû = Revision on unassigned and assigned sections of the code of conduct
      are made without approval, do not follow the GitHub Flow model, and lack a
      Pull request
  * üòï = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval and follow the GitHub flow model, but lack a Pull request
  * üòê = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags a TL
  * üòÉ = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs and Project manager
  * üòé = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs, a Project manager, and another non Project-manager classmate

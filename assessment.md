# Assessment for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk
* Software testing
* Software refactoring

## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about:
  * Python software development
  * Python software testing
  * Project management with GitHub
  * Continuous integration with Travis CI
  * Foundations of software engineering
* Understanding and avoiding red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices

### Group

* Attendance
* Deadlines
  * N = Team member has **poor time management** skills and appears unaware of
    deadlines
  * I = Team member demonstrates a **lack of urgency** as deadline approaches and
    misses work as a result
  * A = Team member **completes** their **required work**, but adheres only to
    technical time constraints and does not leave time for testing or
    correction of errors
  * G = Team member **completes** their **required work** with enough time
    before the deadline to properly test their code/work and enough time to fix
    any errors that may have arisen
  * E = Team member **completes work on time** and encourages others to
    also complete their work with enough time to test it and fix errors.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this professional skill at the
E level by completing their assigned work for the project with enough time
remaining to properly test and document it, and enough time to fix any errors.
Additionally, they should encourage others to complete their work in
a similar time frame such that the project flows as smoothly as possible.

* Communication

* Participation
  * N = Team member is completely **uninvolved** or otherwise provides **no
    significant contribution** to projects
  * I = Team member is **involved** and **contributes** to the project, but
    **does not cooperate** or **communicate** with their team and/or **fulfill
    their role**
  * A = Team member **actively contributes** to the project and **effectively
    communicates** with their team
  * G = Team member **actively contributes** to the project by **fulfilling
    their role / position** and **effectively communicates** with their team,
    especially concerning matters of which their role / position is responsible
    for
  * E = Team member **actively contributes** to the project by **fulfilling
    their role / position** and **effectively communicates** with their team.
    The team member **actively seeks to resolve issues** and **guide** other
    team members in matters concerning their role / position.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this professional skill at the
E level by understanding their role / position within the group and handling
aspects of the project that concern this role / position. Furthermore, they
will effectively communicate their intentions and abilities in order to
maximize productivity.

* Conduct
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
N = Never addresses conflicts with anyone
I = Sometimes addresses conflicts with teammates
A = Addresses conflicts with teammates through communication
G = Addresses conflicts with teammates through mature communication while
involving leaders
E = Addresses conflicts with teammates through mature communication
(slack or the issue tracker in GitHub) while involving leaders and referencing
conduct guide
* Infractions
### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
* Interaction with the team leaders
* Interaction with the course instructor
* Interaction with the student technical leaders

## Revision of Guides

* Policies for revising the assessment form
* Policies for revising the code of conduct

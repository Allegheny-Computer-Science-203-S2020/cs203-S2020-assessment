# cs203-S2019-assessment

This repository contains the assessment sheet for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
will add this assessment sheet to a new GitHub Classroom repository each when
the software engineering team is completing an assignment. The instructor
invites each student in the course to master the technical and professional
skills listed on this assignment sheet.

## Improving the Assessment

Please use the [GitHub flow
model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively improve
the assessment sheet. First, you should finalize the list of technical and
professional skills on which you want to be assessed during the Spring 2019
semester. Then, you should describe the student behaviors that would lead to an
assessment at one of the following levels:

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

Finally, you should explain how the assessment for each of the technical and
professional skills will result in an overall assessment for a software project.
Once you are finished with the assessment, please update the README as
necessary.

## Problems with the Assessment

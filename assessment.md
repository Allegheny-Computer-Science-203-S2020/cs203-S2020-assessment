## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about:
  * Python software development
  * Python software testing
  * Project management with GitHub
  * Continuous integration with Travis CI
  * Foundations of software engineering
* Understanding and avoiding red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices

### Group

* Attendance

  * :disappointed: = Team member is never or rarely present
  * :confused: = Team member is occasionally present and rarely engaged
  * :neutral_face: = Team member is frequently present but not always engaged
  * :smiley: = Team member has two to three unexcused absences and is frequently
    engaged
  * :sunglasses: = Team member has zero to one unexcused absence and is always
    engaged

* Deadlines

  * :disappointed: = Team member has poor time management skills and appears
    unaware of deadlines
  * :confused: = Team member demonstrates a lack of urgency as deadline
    approaches and misses work as a result
  * :neutral_face: = Team member completes their required work, but
    adheres only to technical time constraints and does not leave time for
    testing or correction of errors
  * :smiley: = Team member completes their required work with enough
    time before the deadline to properly test their code/work and enough time to
    fix any errors that may have arisen
  * :sunglasses: = Team member completes work on time and encourages others
    to also complete their work with enough time to test it and fix errors.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this professional skill at the
:sunglasses: level by completing their assigned work for the project with enough
time remaining to properly test and document it, and enough time to fix any
errors. Additionally, they should encourage others to complete their work in a
similar time frame such that the project flows as smoothly as possible.

* Communication
  * :disappointed: = No communication to group
  * :confused: = Little to none communication
  * :neutral_face: = Communication is low and some questions are asked.
  * :smiley: = Communication is used; asks questions and checks slack.
  * :sunglasses: = Communication through slack and email and always check up on group

* Participation

  * :disappointed: = Team member is completely uninvolved or otherwise
    provides no significant contribution to projects
  * :confused: = Team member is involved and contributes to the project,
    but does not cooperate or communicate with their team and/or
    fulfill their role
  * :neutral_face: = Team member actively contributes to the project and
    effectively communicates with their team
  * :smiley: = Team member actively contributes to the project by
    fulfilling their role / position and effectively communicates with
    their team, especially concerning matters of which their role / position is
    responsible for
  * :sunglasses: = Team member actively contributes to the project by
    fulfilling their role / position and effectively communicates with
    their team. The team member actively seeks to resolve issues and
    guide other team members in matters concerning their role / position.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this professional skill at the
:sunglasses: level by understanding their role / position within the group and
handling aspects of the project that concern this role / position. Furthermore,
they will effectively communicate their intentions and abilities in order to
maximize productivity.

* Conduct

  * :disappointed: = Never treats teammates with respect
  * :confused: = Sometimes treats teammates with respect
  * :neutral_face: = Often times treats teammates with respect
  * :smiley: = Treats teammates with respect and controls their behavior around
    others
  * :sunglasses: = Always acknowledges teammates and treats with the upmost
    respect

* Decisions

  * :disappointed: = No conclusive thoughts
  * :confused: = Thoughts are final but most members completely disagree and no
    group input was taken.
  * :neutral_face: = Some members are on page, input was taken, but decision
    was ineffective.
  * :smiley: = Most members are on page, input was taken, and decision was
    effective.
  * :sunglasses: = All member are on page, input was taken, and decision was
    effective and beneficial.

* Postmortems
* Conflicts

  * :disappointed: = Never addresses conflicts with anyone
  * :confused: = Sometimes addresses conflicts with teammates
  * :neutral_face: = Addresses conflicts with teammates through communication
  * :smiley: = Addresses conflicts with teammates through mature communication
    while involving leaders
  * :sunglasses: = Addresses conflicts with teammates through mature
    communication (slack or the issue tracker in GitHub) while involving leaders
    and referencing conduct guide

* Infractions

  * :disappointed: = Never follows the guidelines of the conduct guide.
  * :confused: = Rarely follows the guidelines of the conduct guide.
  * :neutral_face: = Sometimes follows the guidelines of the conduct guide.
  * :smiley: = Always follow the guidelines of the conduct guide.
  * :sunglasses: = Always follow the guidelines of the conduct guide, but also
    makes sure that team members are also following the guidelines.

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
  * N = No effort to change, refine, or contribute to documentation.
  * I = Very short or vague description of documentation
  * A = Conveys information accurately and descriptively enough for everyone to understand
  * G = Well thought-out and descriptive documentation and definitions so
        everyone can be well informed
  * E = A very structured and detailed outlining of all of the elements in
        a software system.
* Software architecture
  * N = No carefully thought-out contribution to the layout of the Project
  * I = Very little amount of shape to the architecture to the Project
  * A = There is some sort of plan for the system
  * G = There is a well thought-out plan for the system
  * E = There is a very detailed and complete plan laid out for the system
* Software design
  * N = No effort to make a design
  * I = Small effort made to put in place a layout of a design system
  * A = Some small designs are able to be seen so a solution is visible
  * G = A solution that is rich in coding layout but architectural design
  * E = All expectations have been exceeded with a well thought-out high level
        software solution with both extremely detailed algorithmic and
        architectural designs.
* Software documentation
  * N = No written communication of how the software works.
  * I = Very little or unclear comments in the code
  * A = Software documentation has a decent bit of detail of the program
  * G = Detailed documentation within the project with ample details of the program
  * E = Very detailed explanation of how to use the software with reasons of
        why certain methods used.
* Programming styles
  * N = No specific style is expressed
  * I = programming style is not clear
* Managing software complexity
    * :disappointed: No complexity managements techniques utilized
    * :confused: Code is frequently non-obvious and complex
    * :neutral_face: Some basic code management is used such as simplicity or simplification
    * :smiley: Most of code is managed using complexity reduction techniques like abstraction
    * :sunglasses: Majority of code effectively uses complexity reduction techniques
                 such as modular design
* Mitigating software risk
    * :disappointed: No risk identified
    * :confused: Minimal risk identified
    * :neutral_face: Some risk identified and basic risk mitigation techniques used
    * :smiley: Most risk identified and some risk mitigation techniques used
    * :sunglasses: Majority risk identified and mitigation techniques used
* Software testing
    * :disappointed: No softwares tested
    * :confused: Minimal softwares tested
    * :neutral_face: Some softwares tested and basic recordings of quality
    * :smiley: Most softwares tested and some recordings of overall quality
    * :sunglasses: Majority softwares tested and recordings of overall quality
* Software refactoring
    * :disappointed:
    * :confused:
    * :neutral_face:
    * :smiley:
    * :sunglasses:

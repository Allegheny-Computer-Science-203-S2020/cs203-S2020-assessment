  flags
  and commands have been incorporated.

  flags
  and commands to improve testing while also providing assistance to other students
  in their use of `pyenv` and `pipenv`.
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
  * :disappointed: = `pylint` and `flake8` not installed or setup.
  * :confused: = `pylint` and `flake8` installed but incorrectly configured and
  unable to run.
  * :neutral_face: = `pylint` and `flake8` able to lint programs but program returns
  linting errors.
  * :smiley: = `pyling` and `flake8` able to lint programs successfully, programs
  contain no linting errors.
  * :sunglasses: = `pylint` and `flake8` able to lint programs, programs contain
  no linting errors, troubleshooting assistance provided for installation and configuring
  of `pylint` and `flake8` to other students.
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`

  * :disappointed: = Did not check coverage
  * :neutral_face: = Checked code coverage using an online provider
  * :sunglasses: = Checked code coverage through an online provider and
  documentation provided.
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
  * :disappointed: = Did not use docstrings
  * :confused: = Incorrectly use of docstrings which are unidentifiable to the
  compiler.
  * :neutral_face: = Added docstrings, but they do not fully describe the
  functions'/methods' effect as a command.
  * :smiley: = Successfully added docstrings with useful description, but they
  lack some proper syntax.
  * :sunglasses: = Successfully added docstring with useful description and
  proper syntax.
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
  * :disappointed: Used unconventional naming styles foreign to python's syntax
  * :confused: Used appropriate naming styles that are not entirely conventional
  * :neutral_face: Used inappropriate naming styles that are not prescriptive or descriptive
  * :smiley: Used appropriate naming styles, but is missing syntax used with variables, function, and methods
  * :sunglasses: Used appropriate naming styles with correct syntax used with variables, functions, and methods
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
  * :disappointed: Code crashes because of no exception handling
  * :confused: Code crashes because of incorrect exception handling
  * :neutral_face: Code does not handle few exceptions
  * :smiley: Code handles most of exceptions
  * :sunglasses: Code handles all exceptions and documents causes
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
  * :disappointed: No refactoring done
  * :confused: Little code refactored and no documentation
  * :neutral_face: Some code refactored and changes documented
  * :smiley: Refactored code contains easy to understand functions and documentation
  * :sunglasses: Refactored code is clean, efficient, well documented, and maintainable
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
  * :disappointed: = No fault-localization and no debugging
  * :confused: = Identifies some of the bugs
  * :neutral_face: = Identifies and fixes some of the bugs using logging and other
  methods
  * :smiley: = Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other methods
  * :sunglasses: = Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other
  methods, and documents them
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
  * :disappointed: = No Python language constructs used
  * :confused: = Incorrect implementation of Python language constructs
  * :neutral_face: = Correct implementation of Python language constructs
  * :smiley: = Correct and efficient implementation of Python language constructs
  * :sunglasses: = Correct and efficient implementation of Python language
  constructs, documentation provided
* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
  * :disappointed: = No Python packages created or used
  * :confused: = Python packages created and/or used incorrectly
  * :neutral_face: = Python packages created/used correctly
  * :smiley: = Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  * :sunglasses: = Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  and the reason is well documented
* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python
  * :disappointed: = Does not follow any of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :confused: = Correctly implements a few of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :neutral_face: = Correctly and efficiently implements some of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python
  * :smiley: = Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry best
  practices for programming in Python
  * :sunglasses: = Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python, and documents their experience

### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
  * :disappointed: = Disregards the customer's feelings, and
  refuses to take their needs into account
  * :confused: = Regards some of the customer's feelings,
  but fails to take their ideas and needs into account
  * :neutral_face: = Regards most of the customer's feelings,
  and takes some of their ideas and needs into account
  * :smiley: = Regards all of the customer's feelings, and
  incorporates most of their ideas and needs while also communicating challenges
  * :sunglasses: = Regards all of the customer's feelings, improves ideas,
  incorporates all of their needs, clearly communicates challenges, and
  provides updates on progress

* Interaction with the team leaders
  * :disappointed: = Impolite, impatient, and does not respond to team leaders
  * :confused: = Polite yet impatient, and is partially responsive to
  team leaders but does not communicate clearly
  * :neutral_face: = Polite, patient, and is mostly responsive to team leaders
  with moderate communication
  * :smiley: = Polite, patient, and is responsive to team leaders with clear
  communication
  * :sunglasses: = Polite, patient, and is responsive to team leaders with clear
  communication which provides multiple progress updates

* Interaction with the course instructor
  * :disappointed: = Impolite, impatient, and does not communicate with the course
  instructor
  * :confused: = Impolite, impatient, and only communicates with the course
  instructor when personally addressed
  * :neutral_face: = Polite yet impatient, and does not communicate clearly with
  the course instructor
  * :smiley: = Polite, patient, and communicates with the course instructor
  * :sunglasses: = Polite, patient, and communicates with the course instructor to
  engage in helpful learning experiences

* Interaction with the student technical leaders
  * :disappointed: = Impolite, impatient, and does not communicate with the technical
  leaders
  * :confused: = Impolite, impatient, and communicates poorly with the technical
  leaders
  * :neutral_face: = Polite yet impatient, and moderately communicates with the
  technical leaders
  * :smiley: = Polite, patient, and effectively communicates with technical leaders
  * :sunglasses: = Polite, patient, and effectively communicates with technical
  leaders to seek advice and help when necessary

### Revision of Guides

This section describes the policies for revising the assessment form and Code of
Conduct. Revision on either of these two repositories must be approved by
project leader and follow the GitHub Flow Model. Additionally, Pull requests for
revision of either guide must tag multiple TL's, a project leader, and another
classmate.

* Policies for revising the assessment form
  * üòû = Revision on unassigned and assigned sections of the assessment form
      are made without approval, do not follow the GitHub Flow model, and lack a
      Pull request
  * üòï = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval and follow the GitHub flow model, but lack a Pull request
  * üòê = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags a TL
  * üòÉ = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs and Project manager
  * üòé = Revision on assigned sections of the assessment form are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs, a Project manager, and another non Project-manager classmate
* Policies for revising the code of conduct
  * üòû = Revision on unassigned and assigned sections of the code of conduct
      are made without approval, do not follow the GitHub Flow model, and lack a
      Pull request
  * üòï = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval and follow the GitHub flow model, but lack a Pull request
  * üòê = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags a TL
  * üòÉ = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs and Project manager
  * üòé = Revision on assigned sections of the code of conduct are made with
      approval, follow the GitHub flow model, and a Pull request that tags
      multiple TLs, a Project manager, and another non Project-manager classmate

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork

* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
  * :disappointed: No effort to change refine or contribute to documentation
  * :confused: Very short or vague description of documentation
  * :neutral_face: Conveys information accurately and descriptively enough for
  everyone to understand
  * :smiley: Well thought-out and descriptive documentation and definitions so
  everyone can be well informed
  * :sunglasses: A very structured and detailed outlining of all of the elements
  in a software system
* Software architecture
  * :disappointed: No carefully thought-out contribution to the layout of the Project
  * :confused: Very little amount of shape to the architecture to the Project
  * :neutral_face: There is some sort of plan for the system
  * :smiley: There is a well thought-out plan for the system
  * :sunglasses: There is a very detailed and complete plan laid out for the system
* Software design
  * :disappointed: No effort to make a design
  * :confused: Small effort made to put in place a layout of a design system
  * :neutral_face: Some small designs are able to be seen so a solution is visible
  * :smiley: A solution that is rich in coding layout and architectural design
  * :sunglasses: All expectations have been exceeded with a well thought-out high
  level software solution with both extremely detailed algorithmic and architectural
  designs
* Software documentation
  * :disappointed: No written documentation of how the code works
  * :confused: Very little or unclear documentation in the code of how the code works
  * :neutral_face: Software documentation has a decent bit of detail describing
  the code and how the program will run
  * :smiley: In-depth detailed documentation within the project that explain the
  reasoning behind the code
  * :sunglasses: Very in-depth detailed explanation of code with use of documentation
  to show and explain how the code will be used
* Programming styles
  * :disappointed: Program is messy, confusing, and has no organized style
  * :confused: Programming is easier to read, but still unclear and disorganized
  * :neutral_face: Program is somewhat understandable, but still lacks clarity
  and organization
  * :smiley: Most of program is easy to understand and read, but still lacks
  organization
  * :sunglasses: Code is easy to read, understand, and organized in a way
  that makes sense
* Managing software complexity
  * :disappointed: No complexity managements techniques utilized
  * :confused: Code is frequently non-obvious and complex
  * :neutral_face: Some basic code management is used such as simplicity or simplification
  * :smiley: Most of code is managed using complexity reduction techniques like abstraction
  * :sunglasses: Majority of code effectively uses complexity reduction techniques
  such as modular design
* Mitigating software risk
  * :disappointed: No risk identified
  * :confused: Minimal risk identified
  * :neutral_face: Some risk identified and basic risk mitigation techniques used
  * :smiley: Most risk identified and some risk mitigation techniques used
  * :sunglasses: Majority risk identified and mitigation techniques used
* Software testing
  * :disappointed: No code is tested
  * :confused: Minimal code is tested
  * :neutral_face: Some individual code is tested and minimal changes made to
  improve quality
  * :smiley: Most of individuals code is tested and changes made to improve quality
  * :sunglasses: Code is tested and changes made to improve overall quality
* Software refactoring
  * :disappointed: No software refactoring or internal changes take place
  * :confused: Little to no refactoring is made to make the code organized
  * :neutral_face: Refactoring is done to improve code structure and readability
  monthly
  * :smiley: Some refactoring is made to enhance readability, simplify code structure,
  and clarify changes biweekly
  * :sunglasses: Code is refactored and changes made to enhance the programs
  readability, simplify code structure, and clarify changes weekly

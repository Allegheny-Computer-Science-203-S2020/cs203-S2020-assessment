# Assessment for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
  * :disappointed: = No team member was assigned to issue.
  * :confused: = Team member was assigned to issue but no response was given.
  * :neutral_face: = Team member was assigned to issue and team member tried to assist
  but no change was made.
  * :smiley: = Team member was assigned to issue and issue was resolved.
  * :sunglasses: = Team member was assigned to issue and issue was resolved and understood.
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
  * N = Not making a branch when it your job
  * I = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork does not work  
  * A = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork works only sometimes
  * G = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork works most of
  the time
  * E = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork works all the
  time
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
  * :disappointed: = Not creating a pull request
  * :confused: = Does not mention the issues it is trying to close with a subpar
   description
  * :neutral_face: = Mentions related issues it is trying to close and describes
   the changes
  * :smiley: = Mentions most related issues it is trying to close, describes most
   changes and the purpose of the pull request
  * :sunglasses: = Mentions all related issues it is trying to close, describes
  all changes made and passes Travis CI
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk
* Software testing
* Software refactoring

## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about:
  * Python software development
  * Python software testing
  * Project management with GitHub
  * Continuous integration with Travis CI
  * Foundations of software engineering
* Understanding and avoiding red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices

### Group

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
  * :disappointed: = No communication to group
  * :confused: = little to none communication
  * :neutral_face: communication is low and some questions are asked.
  * :smiley: communication is used; asks questions and checks slack.
  * :sunglasses: communication through slack and email and always check up on group
* Participation
* Conduct
  * :disappointed: = Never treats teammates with respect
  * :confused: = Sometimes treats teammates with respect
  * :neutral_face: = Often times treats teammates with respect
  * :smiley: = Treats teammates with respect and controls their behavior around others
  * :sunglasses: = Always acknowledges teammates and treats with the upmost respect
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
  * N = Never talks to teammates about conflicts
  * I = Only sometimes talks to teammates about conflicts
  * A = Addresses conflicts with team members
  * G = Addresses conflicts with team members as well as involving the leaders
  * E = Is in constant communication with team members and leaders but also looks
  at the conduct guide.
* Infractions

### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
* Interaction with the team leaders
* Interaction with the course instructor
* Interaction with the student technical leaders

## Revision of Guides

* Policies for revising the assessment form
* Policies for revising the code of conduct

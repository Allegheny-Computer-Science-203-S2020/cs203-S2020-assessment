### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation

* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk
* Software testing
* Software refactoring

## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about:
  * Python software development
  * Python software testing
  * Project management with GitHub
  * Continuous integration with Travis CI
  * Foundations of software engineering
* Understanding and avoiding red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices

### Group

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
* Participation
* Conduct
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
* Infractions

### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
  * :disappointed: Disregards the customer's feelings and
  refuses to take their needs into account
  * :confused: Regards some of the customer's feelings
  but fails to take their ideas and needs into account
  * :neutral_face: Regards most of the customer's feelings
  and takes some of their ideas and needs into account
  * :smiley: Regards all of the customer's feelings and
  incorporates most of their ideas and needs while also communicating challenges
  * :sunglasses: Regards all of the customer's feelings, improves ideas,
  incorporates all of their needs, clearly communicates challenges and
  provides updates on progress

* Interaction with the team leaders
  * :disappointed: Impolite, impatient and does not respond to team leaders
  * :confused: Polite yet impatient and is partially responsive to
  team leaders but does not communicate clearly
  * :neutral_face: Polite, patient and is mostly responsive to team leaders
  with moderate communication
  * :smiley: Polite, patient and is responsive to team leaders with clear
  communication
  * :sunglasses: Polite, patient and is responsive to team leaders with clear
  communication, providing multiple progress updates

* Interaction with the course instructor
  * :disappointed: Impolite, impatient and does not communicate with the course
  instructor
  * :confused: Impolite, impatient and only communicates with the course
  instructor when personally addressed
  * :neutral_face: Polite yet impatient and does not communicate clearly with the
  course instructor
  * :smiley: Polite, patient and communicates with the course instructor
  * :sunglasses: Polite, patient and communicates with the course instructor to
  engage in helpful learning experiences

* Interaction with the student technical leaders
  * :disappointed: Impolite, impatient and does not communicate with the technical
  leaders
  * :confused: Impolite, impatient, does not speak to the technical leaders when
  necessary and communicates poorly
  * :neutral_face: Polite yet impatient and moderately communicates with the
  technical leaders
  * :smiley: Polite, patient and effectively communicates with technical leaders
  * :sunglasses: Polite, patient and effectively communicates with technical
  leaders, seeking advice and help when necessary

  Communication with customers, team leaders, the course instructor and student
  technical leaders can be done in-person, through GitHub and Slack. The most
  comprehensive form of communication includes forms of all three of these methods.

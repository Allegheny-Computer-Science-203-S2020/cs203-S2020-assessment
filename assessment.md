### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
  * Students should receive an 'üòû' if any work is done in the master branch
  instead of the team branch, and/or if there is no discussion or review of the
  code with the team, and/or if no relevant commit messages are used
  * Students should receive an 'üòï' if all work is done in the team branch but
  no relevant commit messages are used, and/or if there is no collaborative
  discussion and review.
  * Students should receive an 'üòê' if all work is done in the team branch,
  commit messages are relevant but not sufficiently descriptive and/or are
  confusing, and engage somewhat in a team review and discussion session.
  * Students should receive a 'üòÉ'if all work is done in the team branch, commit
  messages provide more detail but still may leave room for confusion, and the
  student engages in a team review and discussion session.
  * Students should receive an 'üòé' if all work is done in the team branch,
  commit messages provide extensive depth regarding changes, and the student
  actively engages in and/or initiates a team review and discussion.

* Using the GitHub issue tracker
  * üòû = do not use the issue tracker
  * üòï = occasionally use the issue tracker, issue descriptions are confusing
  * üòê = use the issue tracker, but will still **occasionally** use slack or
  other communication, issue descriptions occasionally confusing
  * üòÉ = use the issue tracker, issue descriptions not as in depth as they
  should be
  * üòé = use the issue tracker, issue descriptions are in depth and clear

* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker

  * :disappointed: = No team member was assigned to issue.
  * :confused: = Team member was assigned to issue but no response was given.
  * :neutral_face: = Team member was assigned to issue and team member tried to
    assist but no change was made.
  * :smiley: = Team member was assigned to issue and issue was resolved.
  * :sunglasses: = Team member was assigned to issue and issue was resolved and
    understood.

* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
  *  :disappointed: = Doing nothing.
  *  :confused:= Assigning but not clarifying tasks.
  *  :neutral_face: = Assigned tasks that are clear but are useless.
  *  :smiley: = Assigning tasks that are clear and beneficial to the group.
  *  :sunglasses: = Assigning tasks that are clear, beneficial and given in a
     timely manner.

* Creating and using a repository branch

  * :disappointed: = **No branches** (other than master) are used, and commits
    are made directly to the master branch.
  * :confused: = A branch is used, but its **name** is **not relevant** to its
    purpose or its function is unnecessary.
  * :neutral_face: = Branch **name** is **relevant** to its function and its
    function is necessary.
  * :smiley: = Branch is **properly created** and necessary, and a **pull
    request** is created once work is completed on the branch.
  * :sunglasses: = Branch is **properly created**, and a **pull request** is
    created once work is completed on the branch. **Guidance** is provided to
    group members who need assistance, ensuring that use of branches is
    **consistent** across team members.

A software engineer demonstrates mastery of this technical skill at the
:sunglasses: level by communicating with their team to determine a naming scheme
for branches, and the plan is executed as agreed upon. The branch(es) being used
should be named according to their role (i.e.
team2-project-management-with-github), and once that role is complete/no longer
necessary, a pull request should be created to merge the branch with the main
branch.

* Creating and using a repository fork
  * üòû = Didn't create or utilize repository forks.
  * üòï = Created unclear repository forks.
  * üòê = Created poorly named repository forks.
  * üòÉ = Created useful named repository forks
  * üòé = Created useful and descriptive repository forks

* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork

  * :disappointed: = Not making a branch when it your job
  * :confused: = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork does
    not work
  * :neutral_face: = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
    works only sometimes
  * :smiley: = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork works
    most of the time
  * :sunglasses: = when merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
    works all the time

* Creating and reviewing a pull request

  * :disappointed: = Not creating a pull request
  * :confused: = Does not mention the issues it is trying to close with a subpar
    description
  * :neutral_face: = Mentions related issues it is trying to close and describes
    the changes
  * :smiley: = Mentions most related issues it is trying to close, describes
    most changes and the purpose of the pull request
  * :sunglasses: = Mentions all related issues it is trying to close, describes
    all changes made and passes Travis CI

* Using appropriate commit messages

  * :disappointed: = **No commits** are made or commit messages are **blank**
  * :confused: = Commit messages are **arbitrary** and/or **vague**
  * :neutral_face: = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and
    **content** associated with the commit files
  * :smiley: = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and **content** as
    well as a **brief description** or list of changes if a commit contains a
    large volume of changes
  * :sunglasses: = Commit messages contain **relevant actions** and **content**
    as well as a **brief description** or list of changes if a commit contains a
    large volume of changes. Additionally, **guidance** is provided to the group
    ensuring members are following a consistent and uniform commit structure.

A software engineer demonstrates the mastery of this technical skill at the
:sunglasses: level by engaging with the team to determine an appropriate commit
scheme and structure (e.g. action-content-file or equally descriptive format),
consistently adhering to said structure, and adding commit descriptions if
deemed necessary (e.g. Adding a list of feature additions / changes / removals
or rationale for said actions).

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

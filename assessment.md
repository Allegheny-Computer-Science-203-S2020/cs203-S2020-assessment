* :neutral_face: = Adequate
* :smiley: = Good
* :sunglasses: = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
  * :disappointed: = Development environment not set up.
  * :confused: = Development environment configured without all required dependencies
  and tools.
  * :neutral_face: = Development environment configured with required dependencies
  and tools.
  * :smiley: = Development environment configured with requirements plus additional
  tools.
  * :sunglasses: = Development environment configured with requirements plus additional
  tools, and assistance to other students with configuration has been provided.
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
  * :disappointed: = `pyenv` and `pipenv` not installed or setup on laptop.
  * :confused: = Program will not run with `pyenv` and `pipenv`.
  * :neutral_face: = Programs are able to run with `pyenv` and `pipenv`.
  * :smiley: = Programs are able to run with `pyenv` and `pipenv` and additional
  flags
  and commands have been incorporated.
  * :sunglasses: = Programs are able to run with `pyenv` and `pipenv` with additional
  flags
  and commands to improve testing while also providing assistance to other students
  in their use of `pyenv` and `pipenv`.
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
  * :disappointed: = `pylint` and `flake8` not installed or setup whatsoever.
  * :confused: = `pylint` and `flake8` installed but incorrectly configured and unable to
  run.
  * :neutral_face: = `pylint` and `flake8` able to lint programs but program returns linting
  errors.
  * :smiley: = `pyling` and `flake8` able to lint programs successfully, programs contain
  no linting errors.
  * :sunglasses: = `pylint` and `flake8` able to lint programs, programs contain no linting
  errors, troubleshooting assistance provided for installation and configuring of
  `pylint` and `flake8` to other students.
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
  * :disappointed: No fault-localization and no debugging
  * :confused: Identifies some of the bugs
  * :neutral_face: Identifies and fixes some of the bugs using logging and other
  methods
  * :smiley: Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other methods
  * :sunglasses: Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other
  methods, and documents them

* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
  * :disappointed: No Python language constructs used
  * :confused: Incorrect implementation of Python language constructs
  * :neutral_face: Correct implementation of Python language constructs
  * :smiley: Correct and efficient implementation of Python language constructs
  * :sunglasses: Correct and efficient implementation of Python language
  constructs, documentation provided

* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
  * :disappointed: No Python packages created or used
  * :confused: Python packages created and/or used incorrectly
  * :neutral_face: Python packages created/used correctly
  * :smiley: Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  * :sunglasses: Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  and the reason is well documented

* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python
  * :disappointed: Does not follow any of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :confused: Correctly implements a few of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :neutral_face: Correctly and efficiently implements some of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python
  * :smiley: Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry best
  practices for programming in Python
  * :sunglasses:  Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python, and documents their experience

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model

* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
  * :disappointed: No effort to change refine or contribute to documentation
  * :confused: Very short or vague description of documentation
  * :neutral_face: Conveys information accurately and descriptively enough for
  everyone to understand
  * :smiley: Well thought-out and descriptive documentation and definitions so
  everyone can be well informed
  * :sunglasses: A very structured and detailed outlining of all of the elements
  in a software system
* Software architecture
  * :disappointed: No carefully thought-out contribution to the layout of the Project
  * :confused: Very little amount of shape to the architecture to the Project
  * :neutral_face: There is some sort of plan for the system
  * :smiley: There is a well thought-out plan for the system
  * :sunglasses: There is a very detailed and complete plan laid out for the system
* Software design
  * :disappointed: No effort to make a design
  * :confused: Small effort made to put in place a layout of a design system
  * :neutral_face: Some small designs are able to be seen so a solution is visible
  * :smiley: A solution that is rich in coding layout and architectural design
  * :sunglasses: All expectations have been exceeded with a well thought-out high
  level software solution with both extremely detailed algorithmic and architectural
  designs
* Software documentation
  * :disappointed: No written documentation or docstrings of how the software works
  * :confused: Very little or unclear documentation or docstrings in the code
  * :neutral_face: Software documentation or docstrings have a decent bit of detail of the program
  * :smiley: Detailed documentation or docstrings within the project with ample details of the
  program
  * :sunglasses: Very detailed explanation of how to use the software with reasons
  of why certain methods used
* Programming styles
  * :disappointed: No specific style is expressed
  * :confused: programming style is not clear
  * :neutral_face: Some programming styles are shown
  * :smiley: Most of program has clear styles being displayed
  * :sunglasses: Majority of program has styles being displayed
* Managing software complexity
  * :disappointed: No complexity managements techniques utilized
  * :confused: Code is frequently non-obvious and complex
  * :neutral_face: Some basic code management is used such as simplicity or simplification
  * :smiley: Most of code is managed using complexity reduction techniques like abstraction
  * :sunglasses: Majority of code effectively uses complexity reduction techniques
  such as modular design
* Mitigating software risk
  * :disappointed: No risk identified
  * :confused: Minimal risk identified
  * :neutral_face: Some risk identified and basic risk mitigation techniques used
  * :smiley: Most risk identified and some risk mitigation techniques used
  * :sunglasses: Majority risk identified and mitigation techniques used
* Software testing
  * :disappointed: No softwares tested
  * :confused: Minimal softwares tested
  * :neutral_face: Some softwares tested and basic recordings of quality
  * :smiley: Most softwares tested and some recordings of overall quality
  * :sunglasses: Majority softwares tested and recordings of overall quality
* Software refactoring
  * :disappointed: No software refactoring takes place
  * :confused: Minimal changes are made to software systems
  * :neutral_face: Some changes to software systems and some internal improvement
  * :smiley: Many changes made to software systems and internal improvement
  * :sunglasses: Majority of changes made to software system and good improvement
  in the internal structure
